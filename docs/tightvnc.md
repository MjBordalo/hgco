# TightVNC
TightVNC is a free remote control software package. With TightVNC, you can see the desktop of a remote machine and control it with your local mouse and keyboard, just like you would do it sitting in the front of that computer.

## Linux Commands
* start: `tightvncserver`
* change password: `vncpasswd`

## Acess it

When on a remote computer connect to the desired computer default port 5901. E.g `hgco.ddns.net:5901`
